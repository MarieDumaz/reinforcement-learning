# Reinforcement Learning

You can find in this repository my homeworks and final project for my Reinforcement Learning class.

Homework 1 was implementing the Policy Iteration algorithm on the taxi problem.

Homework 2 was implementing the REINFORCE algorithm on the inverted pendulum problem.

My final project consisted in implementing Double Deep Q-Learning algorithm to have a robot move to a monolith in the middle of the room on a rough terrain. This problem is part of the Offworld Gym project.
